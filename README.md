### Hi, I'm Mohammad Owais.

I am a Computer Science senior from Pakistan with a deep interest in making machines "see" and understand the world.

Currently, I am focused on **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning**. My goal is to move beyond just using libraries and actually understand the math behind Neural Networks. I plan to pursue my Master's in AI specifically in China to work on advanced research.

**What I'm up to right now:**
-  Training custom object detection models using YOLO.
-  Experimenting with GANs to generate art (and sometimes anime characters).
-  Preparing for my Master's journey.

**Tech Stack:**
Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, C++, and Android (Kotlin).
